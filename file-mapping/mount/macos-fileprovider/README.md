# macOS File Provider Integration

This directory contains the staged macOS File Provider implementation for Host Files.

The goal is to make Moonlight Host Files appear in Finder without requiring macFUSE or any other user-installed filesystem driver.

## Phase 1 Shape

The first implementation phase is intentionally split:

- Qt provider selection lives in `file-mapping/mount/mac_file_provider_mount_provider.*`.
- The native File Provider extension lives under `MoonlightFileProviderExtension/`.
- macOS packaging builds the extension with `scripts/build-macos-fileprovider-extension.sh` and copies it to `Moonlight.app/Contents/PlugIns/`.

Provider order on macOS should be:

1. Apple File Provider.
2. macFUSE runtime provider.
3. Finder mirror fallback.

## Domain Model

Use one active domain per host session:

```text
identifier: moonlight.<hostUuid>.<sessionId>
display:    Moonlight Host Files - <hostName>
```

The app registers the domain when Host Files are ready and removes it when the stream ends.

## Extension Data Flow

The extension must not link Qt. It should use an App Group container or local IPC bridge to reach Moonlight state:

```text
Finder
  -> File Provider extension
  -> Moonlight app-group session store or local IPC
  -> protocol-backed RemoteVfs
  -> Sunshine file-mapping WebSocket
```

## Phase Exit Criteria

M1 is complete when a macOS build can:

- bundle and sign the `.appex`;
- register a mock `Moonlight Host Files` domain;
- show static folders in Finder;
- reveal the Finder location from the overlay.

M2 replaces the mock enumerator with real `RemoteVfs::children()` data.
M3 implements file content materialization through `RemoteVfs::open/read/close`.

## Build Notes

`scripts/generate-dmg.sh` invokes the extension build after `macdeployqt` and before app signing.

Signed builds can set:

```text
MOONLIGHT_FILE_PROVIDER_APP_GROUP=group.com.alkaidlab.vpluspc.FileProvider
```

If the variable is missing, the extension is still bundled for CI/test builds, but it is signed without App Group entitlements.
